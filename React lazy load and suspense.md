# lazy load and suspense

Even though I have used react I never got a chance to work with react lazy load and react suspense. I think both of them where introduced in version 17 but I am not really sure about this so I might have to refer more about it possibly make a blog about the same. Reac lazy allows us to conditionally import modules dynamically according to need. The advantages that the application can be made lightweight which can be achieved as modules are imported only on requirement. React suspense can be implemented to show a fall back UI.
